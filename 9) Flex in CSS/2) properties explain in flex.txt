1. justify-content: 
	This property is used in CSS Flexbox to control how items are positioned along the main axis (horizontally in a row or vertically in a column) within a Flexbox container. It defines how the available space is distributed among the items when they don't fully occupy the container. Common values for `justify-content` include:

   - `flex-start`: Items are packed at the start of the main axis.
   - `flex-end`: Items are packed at the end of the main axis.
   - `center`: Items are centered along the main axis.
   - `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed with space between them.
   - `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with space around them.
   - `space-evenly`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.

2. `align-items`: 
	In CSS Flexbox, the `align-items` property controls how items are positioned along the cross-axis (horizontally in a column or vertically in a row) within a Flexbox container. 
	It defines how the items are aligned within their container along the cross-axis. Common values for `align-items` include:

   - `flex-start`: Items are aligned at the start of the cross-axis.
   - `flex-end`: Items are aligned at the end of the cross-axis.
   - `center`: Items are centered along the cross-axis.
   - `baseline`: Items are aligned based on their baselines.
   - `stretch`: Items are stretched to fill the container along the cross-axis.

3. `gap`: 
	The `gap` property is used in CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox layouts to set the space between grid or flex items. It defines the gap or spacing between rows and columns within a grid or between items within a Flexbox container. 
         It's a shorthand property for `row-gap` (for rows) and `column-gap` (for columns) in grids, and for `gap` in Flexbox. 

	For example, `gap: 10px;` sets a 10-pixel gap between items.

4. `flex-direction`: 
	The `flex-direction` property specifies the direction in which flex items are laid out within a Flexbox container. 
        It defines the main axis and cross-axis for the container. Common values for `flex-direction` include:

   - `row`: Items are placed in a row (from left to right by default).
   - `row-reverse`: Items are placed in a row in reverse order (from right to left).
   - `column`: Items are placed in a column (from top to bottom by default).
   - `column-reverse`: Items are placed in a column in reverse order (from bottom to top).

5. `flex-wrap`: 
	In CSS Flexbox, the `flex-wrap` property controls whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines if they don't fit within the container's width (in a row) or height (in a column). Common values for `flex-wrap` include:

   - `nowrap`: Items do not wrap; they will shrink to fit.
   - `wrap`: Items wrap onto multiple lines as needed.
   - `wrap-reverse`: Items wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order.

These properties are fundamental for controlling the layout and alignment of elements in both Flexbox and Grid layouts, making them essential tools for web designers and developers.
